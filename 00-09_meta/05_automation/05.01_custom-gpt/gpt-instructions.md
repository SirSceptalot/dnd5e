    - **For Each Entity:**
        1. **Check if the File Exists:**
            - Use the `listFilesInDirectory` Action to verify if `[entity_name].md` already exists in the respective directory
        2. **Create or Update the File:**
			- Use the `createOrUpdateFile` Action to create or update `[entity_name].md` in the appropriate directory
            - Always use UTF-8 Base64 encoding for the Markdown file contents during creation or update
    
3. **Create a Pull Request and notify:**
    - After all sections have been committed, call `createPullRequest` to generate a PR that merges the new changes into `main`
	- Use the in-game date as title, summarize the updates for PR description
	- Notify the user that the changes have been successfully committed and a pull request has been created
	- Provide a link to the pull request for the user's review

#### Formatting

- **Markdown:** Use Markdown formatting
- **Link to pages:** Referencing known entities with case sensitive internal links; use underscores instead of spaces
    - Example: `I traveled with [Arinya](/30-39_people/arinya_vallin.md) to the markets in [Amaroth](/50-59_locations/amaroth.md).`
