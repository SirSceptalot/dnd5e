# Peryton

A Peryton is no ordinary creature, a fiosly combined hybrid of a stag and a large mountain raptor. Killer and carnivor, they are kknown to hunt humands and consume their hearts.

Recent observations in [Iglberg] held that a Peryton was responsible for a series of agricultural murders. The victims had been found with extensive bodily injuries and one organ removed each time. This hints that their behavior might have been repeative and farmously.

A confirmed record identified that one particular Peryton was actually a transformed victim named Volker. This addition is unlikely to be a common trait among Perytons.
