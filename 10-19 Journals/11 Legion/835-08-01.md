ARINYA VALLIN&nbsp;Quest led us to the village of Iglberg. The most notable individuals present were an elven administrator, Emil, overseeing a small encampment of soldiers, and a tortle named Tiziano Vecellio, who was inspecting a notice. The notice detailed a bounty for a creature preying on local farmers — a Peryton, a hybrid of stag and bird.

Tiziano expressed skepticism regarding the creature’s guilt and insisted on an investigation before engaging in combat. Arinya and I agreed to this approach. Emil provided names of three widows who had lost their husbands to the alleged predator:

- **Waltraud**: Witnessed the attack on her husband.
- **Kajetan**: Another widow, also a witness.
- **Mina**: Wife of the first victim, did not see the attack but discovered the body.
